# Anki Wrapped ([ankiwrapped.com](https://ankiwrapped.com/))

It's like Spotify Wrapped but for Anki.

Here's how it works:

- In Anki, you export your collection as `.colpkg`, and drop it on the site
- The site extracts your stats for 2025 locally in your browser
- You get a pretty image with your Anki stats, which you can download and share

Everything happens locally in the browser.

Built by the team behind [Rember](https://www.rember.com/).

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies
3. Start the development server using `pnpm dev`

Open http://localhost:5173 with your browser to see the result.
